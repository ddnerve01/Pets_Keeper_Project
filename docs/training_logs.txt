so -- shared object
dll -- dynamic link library

Librares are located on /system/lib/
such as libwebcore.so, libril.so
but surface manager is a exception.

JVM -- dalvik virtual machine
each app has it own Dalvik VM instance.
the source is located in android/dalvik

libc --- C library, is located in android/bionic

both bionic and dalvik contain important functions.

android/device/asus/grouper  --> Nexus7 

android/external  --> contain a lot of open source projects.
AOSP -- android opensource project
HAL -- hardware abstraction layer

android/libcore -- JAVA library developed by apache harmony, not sun or oracle.

in this lecture we only focus on 4 directories: bionic, dalvik, framework, system.

we use vim+ctags to analyse source code.
$ctags *
ctags file contain all the function and variable lables.
open vim to edit a file, choose a function, press ctrl+] to the func, press ctrl+t to return.
To build the ctags database: $ctags -R bionic/ dalvik/ frameworks/ system/

init is located in android-2.2.x/system/core/init, it's the first process to start when boot Android system.

Power on
-> CPU reset
-> Bootloader: Hardware checking & initializtion
			   Kernel & RAMdisk loading
-> Linux kernel
-> init (ex: System-V init, Upstart init ...)

Types

zygote is the base process responsible for start all the Android services.
it's the parent process of all the JAVA services.

make -j(# of CPUs)
make -j(# of CPUs * 2)
make -j(# of CPUs + 2)

make -j2
make -j4

----------------------------------

init.rc include two parts: Action(commands) and Service(deamons)
Actions --> 1.early init, 2.init, 3.early-boot, 4.boot
Services --> a lots of...

init process monitor all the child process, if the child process go to zombie and exit, the init will decide whether to recreate or kill it.

<TODAY ASSIMENTS>
1. Building the 4.2.x platform source for the emulator.
2. Study vim editor.(ctags usage)
3. Read chapter 1 of ebook "Embedded Android".
