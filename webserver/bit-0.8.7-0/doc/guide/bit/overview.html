            <h1>Embedthis Bit&trade; Overview</h1>
        <p>Bit means <em>Build It</em>, and it is a modern replacement for the venerable 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a> and not so popular 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconf">autoconf</a> utilities. Bit manages the building of
        programs and products by simply and efficiently determining which pieces have been updated and thus which
        components need to be rebuilt. It easily handles the direct compilation and generation of projects 
        and Makefiles.</p>
        <h2>A Simple Bit File</h2>
        <p>A bit file is a Javascript file with a .bit extension that invokes Bit.load to process a set of build
        instructions. The build instructions are expressed as a Javascript object literal. For example:
        <pre>
Bit.load({
    targets: {
        /* Build the rocket executable */
        rocket: {
            type: 'exe',
            sources: '*.c',
        },
    }, 
})
</pre>
        <p>Bit knows how to build compile sources, build libraries and create executables, and can do this
        on multiple operating systems and platforms with a unified bit project definition.</p>
        <a id="overview"></a>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Bit parses bit files that have a <em>.bit</em> extension. Bit files are contain a Javascript literal 
            that describes what to build. Arbitrary Javascript is permitted in bit files, but 
            typically little script code is needed.</p>
        <p>Bit files specify targets to build. These can be source files, libraries, executables or other actions to run.
        Bit has built-in rules to compile source code, build libraries, executables, copy files, build packages and generate
        IDE projects. So you typically need to type very little to do the common tasks of building.</p>
        <p>Bit files can intelligently inherit global settings for a project and can override or augment values
        locally. Bit files run with a current directory set to that of the bit file itself, so it can 
        easily reference local resources. Bit projects are fully relocatable and avoid absolute directory
        references except for global tool chain programs and directories.</p>
        <p>Bit provides a "configure" capability where it searches for required and optional tools for building. 
        Bit also supports cross-platform and cross-compilation building.</p>
        <a id="whyBit"></a>
        <h2>Why Bit?</h2>
        <p>Many projects rely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoconf">autoconf</a> autoconf 
        to configure products and the make utility to build. But autoconf is a baroque maze of
        scripts and make is provides too little support for easily building executable and libraries in a cross platform
        manner. Further, neither of these tools work well for Windows and embedded platforms like VxWorks. 
        Consequently, creating portable Makefiles and autoconf scripts that will work on a variety of platforms
        and support cross compilation is an exercise in patience. Often the result is slow, fragile build
        systems, especially on Windows.</p>
        <p>Bit replaces both autoconf and make with a single utility: <em>bit</em>. Bit provides a higher level of
        abstraction to easily specify the targets to build (libraries and executables). It can build directly on Linux,
        Mac or Windows and cross compile for other platforms. It will generate native projects for Visual Studio,
        XCode, Make, Nmake and shell scripts. Bit builds fast without the complexity of autoconf and
        make.</p>
        <p>Bit was initiated after evaluating Make, CMake and GYP for use by the 
        <a href="http://embedthis.com/products/appweb/embedded-web-server.html">Appweb</a> and 
        <a href="http://embedthis.com/products/ejs">Ejscript</a> projects 
        in an embedded, cross compilation environment. While all three alternatives can be made to work, we 
        (<a href="http://embedthis.com/">Embedthis</a>)
        were expending too large a percentage of our time on the build system and less on the actual products. Out of this
        frustration was born Bit. We do not expect Bit to be a universal replacement for Make or Autoconf for everyone, 
        but for some users, it may be a good choice.</p>
        
        <h3>Bit Design Goals</h3> 
        <p>When creating Bit, our design goals were:</p> <ul>
            <li>Create a build tool to be used by Embedthis for its own products</li>
            <li>Be portable across the major Unix platforms and Windows</li>
            <li>Easily manage cross-compilation and cross-compilers for embedded targets</li>
            <li>Generate native projects for IDE integration</li>
            <li>Build quickly, reliably and flexibly on windows without relying on Cygwin</li>
            <li>Support the entire build cycle: C dependencies, compilation, test and packaging</li>
            <li>Support the modular discovery, configuration and integration of external third-party packages</li>
            <li>Be hackable and extendable and eventually usable by all</li>
        </ul>
        <a id="differences"></a>
        <h2>Differences vs Make</h2>
        <p>Here is a quick list of differences between bit and the make utility. These are broad, sweeping, opinionated
            comments with hopefully a grain of truth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Makefiles don't aggregate well. Make provides little support for combining makefiles. It offers bare
            facilities for inheriting and overriding project parameters in an orderly fashion.  Large projects often use
            recursive makefiles, but these have many well 
            <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf">documented</a> issues.  Trying to combine Makefiles from
            different products is typically not possible.
            Bit creates a single, unified view of how to build an entire product. The product may be comprised of many bit
            files, but these are combined in a well-defined manner. Lower-level bit files can inherit properties from upper
            levels and easily locally override settings as required.</li>
            <li>Bit is pre-programmed with default compiler and linker switches to achieve common tasks.
                With make, you have to add the switches yourself.</li>
            <li>Bit provides in-built understanding of how to build common targets like libraries and executables.
                With make, you have to specifically express the link command lines.</li>
            <li>Makefiles are often a mess. Bit files are terse and because bit provides high-level understand of
            how to build libraries and executables, there is little boiler-plate build rules.</li>
            <li>Make and autoconf try to run on every possible Unix, but don't run on Windows (except for cygwin which
            is too unreliable for production use). Bit supports the major Unix flavors: Linux, BSD, MAC OS X. But it also
            supports Windows with ease.
            <li>Autoconf is incomprehensible. Just google "hate autoconf". It is a mess of legacy shell scripts that
            try to address building on all possible systems, but fail at building well on the common platforms. 
            Bit does not try to create the universal config.h header to mange obscure C compilers. It focusses on the 
            dominant platforms. Bit provides an open, extensible framework for searching for extension packages that makes
            it easy to configure a build based on packages available on the target computer.</li>
            <li>Bit is fast and is typically much faster than autoconf and make. Because it uses Ejscript internally, 
            file copy and script commands can be executed without spawning a shell. This also means that you can have
            a uniform scripting environment on Windows.</li>
        </ul>
