Avilib  Some utilities for writing and reading AVI files.
 *  These are not intended to serve for a full blown
 *  AVI handling software (this would be much too complex)
 *  The only intention is to write out MJPEG encoded
 *  AVIs with sound and to be able to read them back again.
 *  These utilities should work with other types of codecs too, however.
